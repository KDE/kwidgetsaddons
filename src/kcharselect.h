/**
 * @class KCharSelect kcharselect.h KCharSelect
 *
 * @short Character selection widget
 *
 * This widget allows the user to select a character of a
 * specified font and to browse Unicode information
 *
 * \image html kcharselect.png "KCharSelect Widget"
 *
 * You can specify the font whose characters should be displayed via
 * setCurrentFont(). Using the Controls argument in the contructor
 * you can create a compact version of KCharSelect if there is not enough
 * space and if you don't need all features.
 *
 * KCharSelect displays one Unicode block at a time and provides
 * categorized access to them. Unicode character names and further details,
 * including cross references, are displayed. Additionally, there is a search
 * to find characters.
 *
 * By default, KCharSelect is restricted to Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
 * characters that QChar supports, i.e. characters with code points that
 * fit into a quint16 (U+0000..U+FFFF). API methods that have a QChar
 * argument can only be used for this default mode:
 *
 * To get the current selected character, use the currentChar()
 * method. You can set the character which should be displayed with
 * setCurrentChar().
 *
 * If you want the user to select and search characters from all planes,
 * i.e. characters U+0000..U+10FFFF, use setAllPlanesEnabled(true)
 * and use the @c uint based methods currentCodePoint() and
 * setCurrentCodePoint() instead.
 *
 * Since QString does not allow @c uint code points, you either must
 * use QString::fromUcs4() and QString::ToUcs4() to convert between
 * strings and code points, or manually do the surrogate pair handling
 * using QChar::requiresSurrogates() and friends.
