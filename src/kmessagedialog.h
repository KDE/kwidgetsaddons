/**
 * @class KMessageDialog kmessagedialog.h <KMessageDialog>
 *
 *
 * @brief KMessageDialog creates a message box similar to the ones you get from KMessageBox,
 * but that can be used asynchronously, i.e. you can show the dialog by using @c show()
 * or @c open().
 *
 * This class contructs a dialog similar to the dialogs the KMessageBox convenience functions
 * create. The main difference is that the KMessageBox methods typically use @c exec() to show
 * the dialogs; one of the main disadvantages of using @c exec(), is that it starts a nested
 * eventloop, which could lead to nasty crashes.
 *
 * Another difference is that the API is supposed to be slightly easier to use as it has
 * various methods to set up the dialog, e.g. @ref setCaption(), @ref setDetails() ...etc.
 *
 * By default, appropriate buttons based on the dialog type are added (since 5.85) (e.g. an
 * "OK" button is added to an Information dialog), you can set custom buttons by using the
 * @ref setButtons() method.
 *
 * The @ref QDialog::done() slot is called to set the result of the dialog, which will emit the
 * @ref QDialog::finished() signal with that result. The result is one of the
 * KMessageDialog::ButtonType enum. This is useful as you can tell exactly which button
 * was clicked by the user. E.g.:
 * - the secondary action button having been clicked, in which case you may still want to save the status
 *   of the "Do not ask again" CheckBox
 * - the "Cancel" button having been clicked, in which case you ideally will ignore the status
 *   of the "Do not ask again" CheckBox
 *
 * For "warning" dialogs, i.e. dialogs with a potentially destructive action, the default
 * button is set to a button with the QDialogButtonBox::RejectRole. If the "Cancel" button
+ * is used, it will be the default, otherwise the secondary action button.
 *
 * This class intends to be very flexible with the buttons that can be used, since you can
 * call the @ref setButtons() method with a KGuiItem that has custom text/icon.
 *
 * Since Frameworks 5.97 a notification sound is played when the dialog opens like KMessageBox
 * does, this can be controlled using the @ref setNotifyEnabled() method.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * auto *dlg = new KMessageDialog(KMessageDialog::QuestionTwoActionsCancel,
 *                                QStringLiteral("Back or forward?"),
 *                                nullptr);
 *
 * dlg->setCaption(QStringLiteral("Window Title"));
 * dlg->setButtons(KStandardGuiItem::back(), KStandardGuiItem::forward(), KStandardGuiItem::cancel());
 * dlg->setListWidgetItems(QStringList{QStringLiteral("file1"), QStringLiteral("file2")});
 * dlg->setDetails(QStringLiteral("Some more details."));
 * dlg->setDontAskAgainText(QStringLiteral("Do not ask again"));
 * dlg->setDontAskAgainChecked(false);
 *
 *  // Delete the dialog when it's closed
 *  dlg->setAttribute(Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose);
 *  // Make the dialog window modal
 *  dlg->setWindowModality(Qt::WindowModal);
 *
 *  QObject::connect(dlg, &QDialog::finished, &app, [dlg](int result) {
 *      auto button = static_cast<KMessageDialog::ButtonType>(result);
 *      switch(button) {
 *      case KMessageDialog::PrimaryAction:
 *          // The user clicked the primary action, handle the result...
 *          // save the "do not ask again" box status...
 *          break;
 *      case KMessageDialog::SecondaryAction:
 *          // The user clicked the secondary action, handle the result...
 *          // save the "do not ask again" box status...
 *          break;
 *      case KMessageDialog::Cancel:
 *          // The user clicked cancel, reject the changes...
 *          break;
 *      default:
 *          break;
 *      }
 *  });
 *
 *  dlg->show();
 * @endcode
