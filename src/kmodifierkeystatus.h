 *
 * Get information about the state of the keyboard's modifier keys.
 *
 * This class provides cross-platform information about the state of the
 * keyboard's modifier keys and the mouse buttons and allows to change the
 * state as well.
 *
 * It recognizes two states a key can be in:
 * @li @em locked: eg. caps-locked (a.k.a. toggled)
 * @li @em latched the key is temporarily locked but will be unlocked upon
 *                          the next keypress.
 *
 * An application can either query the states synchronously (isKeyLatched(),
 * isKeyLocked()) or connect to KModifierKeyStatus's signals to be notified about
 * changes (keyLatched(), keyLocked()).
 *
 * @since 5.87
